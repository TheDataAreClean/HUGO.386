      <description>__  For all its faults, working in the development sector is fairly satisfying. Not always rewarding, but satisfying. In my short-ish experience working the space for the last few years I was always the “Data Guy” in the office, also the default tech support in some cases. That’s says a lot when I truly believe I am not a tech person in the remotest sense of the word.</description>

      <description>__  For a while I have been wondering what constitutes being a leader, how do you differentiate a good one from a bad one, how do you even evaluate their contributions? Do you lead by example or by guidance? If being a leader means giving everyone the space to have a voice, does it also mean checking with everyone if they have something to say? Does any of this even matter if the only thing that anyone looks at is the final output?</description>
