      <description>__  It’s only Tuesday and I have already had a fairly exhausting week. I had a plan to write my blog a little early today and go to bed on time, something I haven’t been able to do for the past week. But then I was reminded, by the beautiful Twitter, that there is an Apple Event today. There went my entire plan, and I am writing this blog at 11:30 in the night.</description>
