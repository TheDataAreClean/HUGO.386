      <description>__  Do you know about machine learning? Do you know about artificial intelligence? Do you know that it’s the greatest thing that has ever happened in the history of the universe? Do you know data is the new oil? Are you loosing out on the discovery of the century? Do you want to know the secret? Don’t you need to succeed in your business? How can you have a business that thinks rationally and doesn’t fall for this bullshit?</description>

      <description>__  Today my friend shared a tweet with me which caught my my atention. The tweet was by Kareem Carr, who by the way is amazing and you should follow if you work with R or Statistics, bringing everyone’s attention to the tidyquant package. Apparently when you load the package it serves with an “ad”. But before we get into the whole idea of what this means and why does it matter.</description>

      <description>__  I love technology I absolutely love it! The joy of possessing a new gadget, trying out a new app, figuring out how pieces of technology operate and customise them exactly to meet my needs. The better something is made, the more there is opportunity to mould it, I am sold! Take my money, please make my life better.
 What is all the FOSS about? On top of all the gifts (and problems) technology has given to this world, probably the absolute best thing in my opinion is the FOSS ecosystem.</description>
