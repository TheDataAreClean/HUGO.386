      <description>__  Today I want to talk about a topic that is closely intertwined with my identity, specifically my online identity. I am talking about TheDataAreClean, my username literally everyone one the internet. A couple of place I had to use an underscore at the end (mostly due to my mistake), and I am still annoyed about that. The story of why I picked this name is really short, but I have to fill this blog with some content.</description>

One aspect that I beleive is still underserved is the data literacy and capacity of the organisation in the space. In todayâ€™s world where data has become such a key factor in of the impact conversation, for good or for bad, it requires more attention. Even when substantial data collection efforts are undertaken by any organisation, the data architecture is always an after thought.</description>
