    <p class="lead">The routine shit..</p>
    


<ul>
<li>__</li>
</ul>
<p>It was one of those days today. I woke up late in the morning, didn’t have my coffee, didn’t read my newsletters, just sat down to work as my first piece of action. I love absolutely love my work, but I never want to start my day there. I want to come to it all fresh and breezy, bringing every bit of excitement to start doing my thing. And all the things I mentioned before help me do just that, exactly those things. Never more, never less.</p>
<p>As a result I was uneasy the entire day, moving from one thing to another never feeling satisfied. Even when the work was good, the day felt incomplete. I kept opening my newsletters in new tabs of my browser, staring at them, unsuccessfully trying to find time to read. In the evening when I finally did get some time, I was exhausted and annoyed and couldn’t bring myself to read a single word.</p>
<p>I am a creature of habit. I love doing my daily list of small things. My days are planned in advance and I know exactly what I want to do. The routine brings a kind of stability which just supports everything. I highly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/magazine/my-father-leaned-on-routine-to-create-stability-now-i-do-too.html" target="_blank">recommend</a> this to everyone. It’s this unparalleled peace of mind that no matter what comes your way, some things will always be there.</p>
<p>But there are also days like today, when things don’t go exactly the way you planned and you get thrown off the path a little bit. And when you rely on these micro habits, any resistance feels like being hit by a truck. How do you do everything else when you can’t do your regular shit.</p>
<p>I believe that’s also the great thing about routine, you can just go back to it tomorrow. I know exactly what I will be doing when I wake up tomorrow morning, and I already love it.</p>
<p>That’s all for today I guess, some half baked thoughts. I am too tired and annoyed for anything more that that. Maybe I will give the newsletters another shot before I got to sleep.</p>
