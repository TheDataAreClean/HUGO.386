<p>I had a fairly fruitful weekend this time around. Went on a couple of great walks, got enough time to relax, wrote a <a href="https://thedataareclean.com/tags/abitw/" target="_blank">series</a> of blogs on a topic I deeply care about. And I am fairly proud of what I wrote. If you’d have asked me earlier will I ever write anything like this, specially during a pandemic, I would’ve laughed at you. And then I would’ve laughed at myself.</p>
<p>All the writing also gave me a bajillion new ideas that I wanted to try, new formats I wanted to test, make some threads more periodical, etc. etc. At the same time, all that writing also exhausted me beyond anything. It might have just been a few hours but the mental bandwidth writing demands is insane. No surprise that people whine even when they are good at the whole writing business.</p>
<p>One more thing all this writing does is that it makes you hyper aware of your surroundings and your own thoughts. You are subconsciously always looking for content. Any idea that you can invest 60 minutes on and hopefully add some value to the world in the process.</p>
<p>What all this awareness did for me was it brought back all the feelings I had successfully ignored for a later date. I am fairly decent at filling my time with random “productive” stuff so I don’t have to think about the crappy shit too much. Becomes trickier when the activity you decided to fill your time with is the one making you think about it.</p>
<p>That led me to today, an exhausting Monday right after a weekend of decent writing. Too tired to try something new, I was faced with the reality of my thoughts wondering which flying bag of poop I want to catch today. The answer was, none of them. It might take a little more strength to become the person I want to be. Until then, stupid jokes it is!</p>
<p>That’s all I have for today, me trying to put together a bunch of thoughts in an attempt to make it pass as readable content. I am not sure if writing about these thoughts will solve anything this time. If you have been reading regularly or found value in any of my blogs, do let me know. It might give me something new to try, while I take time to deal with other shit. <strong>In private</strong>. I will happily take you ideas and pretend they are my own, I have to write for 83 more days straight after all. Thank you for sticking around till the end.</p>
