One reason amongst many [others](https://thedataareclean.com/blog/2020-08-25-abitw-four/){target="_blank"} I care about the education space is my experience with teachers. When I think back to my school or college, I can remember one, maybe two teachers that had any impact on shaping my academic career. All those interactions just toughened me up to not tolerate a lot of bullshit in life.

To be fair, I wasn't a great kid either. I was a menace, always talking in the classroom, making difficult for any teacher to teach me. In my defence, most of them weren't trying to teach us anyway. They just wanted us to mug up stuff so we clear whatever test or exam was coming up next. I have had teacher that were reciting theorems in class so we note them down and learn for the exams, without ever telling us what its supposed to be do. On top of all of that, because of my behaviour, they loved mentioning I would not be able to achieve anything in life. Oh well..

All these experiences have left a lot feelings inside me, obviously. And I am not sure if I actually blame the teachers for all of it. Sure they did end up doing some incredibly stupid shit, but they also work in an extremely underpaid and underappreciated environment. They get barely any support, while having one of the most important roles in the life of a growing child. Then they also encountered kids like me who are total dicks. It's not easy.

All these experiences ended up with me having a lot of opinions both on teachers and teaching. And with my personal encounters with teaching others I came to the realisation that I want to teach one day. I thoroughly enjoy doing sessions whenever I get a chance, and I always prep extra hard no matter who I am interacting with. I understand being in a class and not gaining anything, I don't want anyone else to experience the same.

I am not really sure on who will teach and what will I teach them, the details are pending. Maybe something I know I won't do is teach young kids, it's damn tough and they are the worst. I would prefer to interact with people who care a little more about what they are learning. But I guess all of that comes later and who knows what will come my way. Right now I have to go back and figure out how do I reach there.
