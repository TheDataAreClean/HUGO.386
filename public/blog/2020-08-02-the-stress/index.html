        <h1>The Stress - Sun, Aug 2, 2020</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Why did I think this was a good idea?</p>
    


<ul>
<li>__</li>
</ul>
<p>Yesterday, I took the “brave” step of publishing my <a href="https://thedataareclean.com/blog/2020-08-01-manifesto/" target="_blank">first ever blog</a>. It was mostly an announcement about of this journey I have embarked on. Somewhere in the mix was also this <strong>GRAND</strong> declaration of writing everyday for 100 days. 100 days of stuff which I feel is worth talking about. That’s a lot of stuff, especially when I live alone, talk to just 3 people and have no clue how popular culture works.</p>
<div id="the-easy-bit" class="section level1">
<h1>The easy bit</h1>
<p>One thing surprised me a lot about the whole experience, how easily I was able to put all of it down on the paper (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> file). Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I am a natural, pro, type A individual who just makes things happen. Maybe because it was just an announcement and a few stupid jokes along the way, I managed.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-rush-bit" class="section level1">
<h1>The rush bit</h1>
<p>At the end of the day I was filled with excitement and numerous brilliant (atleast in my head) ideas for things I want to talk about. Maybe I should make a list, maybe I should detail some of them, maybe I should write one in preparation for tomorrow!</p>
</div>
<div id="the-feelings-bit" class="section level1">
<h1>The feelings bit</h1>
<p>How the education system in our country is a shit show, and the <a href="https://www.livemint.com/education/news/mphil-to-be-discontinued-and-other-key-points-in-national-education-policy-11596022845294.html" target="_blank">NEP</a> announcement this week. How <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a> is amazing, yet so difficult to adopt in every aspect of life. How cycling is beautiful, therapeutic and so much more.</p>
<p>Enter, anxiety. I am not really a education policy expert, I don’t really use open source that much, I haven’t really cycled for a while because of the pandemic.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-stressful-bit" class="section level1">
<h1>The stressful bit</h1>
<p>There was this constant voice in my head, asking me to write something important, asking me to not waste other people’s time. If I don’t have something important to say, or add value to an already existing conversation of internet intellectuals, maybe I shouldn’t speak at all.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-important-bit" class="section level1">
<h1>The important bit</h1>
<p>Thanks to a small interaction with my friend I remembered why I started this. Improving my writing, my confidence and not break the streak. I just need to start writing, something might come along.</p>
<p>So maybe that is what I will do going forward, talk about stuff that is present for me. If the world finds value in it, you are welcome! See you on the next one.</p>
