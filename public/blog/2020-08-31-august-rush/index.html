<h1>Milestone</h1>
<p>Today marks one month of me writing and publishing a new blog every day. It’s been an insane experience and something I would’ve never imagined myself doing. As I am almost a third of the way into my journey of writing for <a href="https://thedataareclean.com/blog/2020-08-01-manifesto/" target="_blank">100 days</a>. I thought I will do one of those reflection blogs. Share my experience of setting up and writing this blog with everyone. Minimal effort, maximum feelings. Hope you enjoy it.</p>
</div>
<div id="technology" class="section level1">
<h1>Technology</h1>
<p>First of all, the setup. I am an absolute tech noob and have no experience whatsoever in creating or hosting websites. When I started setting up my own website for the first time I had used Wix, which to be fair is pretty neat and powerful, I just never got comfortable with it. It was a feature overkill, it wasn’t open source and I really wanted to use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> (a programming language I love) to build my website. I used the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown" target="_blank">Blogdown</a> package in R to generate static websites based on <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. In short, the package took care of the design and the hosting, I just had to worry about the content (and my jokes). The design thing reminds me, I am thinking of changing my website design again. I am getting bored of the whole bootstrap thing and want to pick something absolutely plain and minimal so I just stick with it forever.</p>
</div>
<div id="content" class="section level1">
<h1>Content</h1>
<p>Writing overall has been amazing fun. Sure I have had bad days where I didn’t want to write, or days where I have just written garbage I will probably never go back to, but overall I am pretty satisfied with how it went. I am also pleasantly surprised how comfortably I was able to transition into writing regularly, even if it wasn’t anywhere near the best quality. The thing I am most happy about it that I am less scared to write on things I care about, I am more trusting of my research and my thought process. I know the next month will be incredibly difficult, but I am looking forward to writing more.</p>
</div>
<div id="sharing" class="section level1">
<h1>Sharing</h1>
<p>One thing about the whole writing journey that has surprised me the most is how I have started sharing a lot more with the world. I am a fairly private person and I don’t like sharing a lot of information about myself anywhere. But with writing I just feel more comfortable talking about things I wouldn’t in real life. Maybe it’s the pressure of producing new content everyday or just the relief of being able to articulate my thoughts without the fear of being judged. I still don’t know, but I want to keep going and find out one day.</p>
</div>
<div id="introsepction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introsepction</h1>
<p>Lastly, I am thankful to writing. The whole process has changed the way I interact with the world around me. I am so much more attentive, mindful and welcoming of new thoughts and conversations. Even if it’s not conversations I just feeling writing is becoming this session at the end of the day where I talk to myself and articulate what’s present for me. Something I find difficult to do in my head because I am always fighting with my own thoughts. It’s like giving myself the opportunity to be me. I am excited to find out what the remaining 69 days have in store for me. Nice.</p>
