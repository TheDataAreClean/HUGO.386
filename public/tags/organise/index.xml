      <description>__  I have a small confession to make. I absolutely didn’t feel like writing today. I have been working on a report and for the last couple of weeks and writing the first draft and it’s become a bit of an overload. I was struggling nailing down a topic for today and have started writing this at 22:31 HRS, by which time I am usually asleep, and I still don’t have a clear idea on today’s blog.</description>
