      <description>__  I am obsessed with organisation. Day 2 of being back home, I was already cleaning up cupboards and organising my room. I love when everything is stored in a place made exactly for it. In short, I am insufferable. But leaving that part aside, I love doing the same thing for my work. Using productivity tools to meticulously document and arrange every last piece and then bask in the glory of perfection.</description>

      <description>__  I have a small confession to make. I absolutely didn’t feel like writing today. I have been working on a report and for the last couple of weeks and writing the first draft and it’s become a bit of an overload. I was struggling nailing down a topic for today and have started writing this at 22:31 HRS, by which time I am usually asleep, and I still don’t have a clear idea on today’s blog.</description>
