      <description>__  I want to talk about a topic that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. I don’t remember how young was I when I first understood it’s meaning, but I remember thinking: “Sure, this makes sense.”. And something else that fascinated me was how much everyone hypes it up. I am talking about death. Yep, today I will be discussing the D word and related things.</description>
