      <description>__  Today marks the third day of my complex feelings around work and culture. I feel like I have landed on something here, even if itâ€™s just a bunch of feelings with no end in sight. And like the other two days, today I am attempting to make sense of all my feelings again. Mostly to go to sleep, leaving all the anxiety on this blog.
One thing to know about me is that I am an overenthusiastic cutlet.</description>

      <description>__  I am an extremely competitive person. I will stress the fuck out when someone is better than me at the thing I care about, constantly wondering what can I do to get better. But I am not competitive in the way that I want to beat you, more like I want to reach where you are so I can have a great conversation with you.
And I will work really hard to reach the point, a lot of times to my own detriment.</description>
