      <description>__  For all its faults, working in the development sector is fairly satisfying. Not always rewarding, but satisfying. In my short-ish experience working the space for the last few years I was always the “Data Guy” in the office, also the default tech support in some cases. That’s says a lot when I truly believe I am not a tech person in the remotest sense of the word.</description>

      <description>__  I had been sitting for over 30 minutes, pondering what do I write about today. I had a fairly exhausting day and am travelling this weekend, both keeping my mind fairly occupied. I am also sitting with this feeling of being annoyed and thinking, I still have to finish writing bedfore I end my day. Noticing my annoyance I wonder, was committing to 100 days of writing a good idea.</description>

      <description>__  Rant I have realised that I am getting old now. I am a very morning person who gets up at 6 and sleeps latest by 10 every night, haven’t stuck to it since the writing journey began, but I still make sure I don’t stretch it. Yesterday I worked late into the the night for the first time in years and didn’t get enough sleep. The entire day today I was exhausted out of my mind, to the point I had to take a nap in the middle of the day to feel better.</description>

      <description>__  Mistakes I have a big learning problem, learning from my experiences that is. I have to really go to the extreme and be completely smashed to bits before I understand, that maybe I have made a mistake going down this path. It’s still a maybe. And by the time I realise it, I have already invested so much energy and time into the task it sort of becomes a point of no return.</description>

      <description>__  If you have come here for the first time, welcome! It’s mostly me talking about my feelings and other shit. And if you have been here before, you know the drill. Nothing beyond this statement is going to make any sense.
So if you have been here before you might also know that last week I made a commitment to write for 100 days straight to get over my fear of writing and improve my skills along the way.</description>

      <description>__  PSA: I am too late to the writing party tonight. It’s 2136 HRS at the time of me starting and I am fairly tired, might be pretty much garbage. Feel free to skip this one, but I shall persevere!
Learn I can’t sit still, I am always doing something or going to do something. I am a restless being and mostly just stop when I go to sleep.</description>
