      <description>__  Today I want to talk about a topic that is closely intertwined with my identity, specifically my online identity. I am talking about TheDataAreClean, my username literally everyone one the internet. A couple of place I had to use an underscore at the end (mostly due to my mistake), and I am still annoyed about that. The story of why I picked this name is really short, but I have to fill this blog with some content.</description>
