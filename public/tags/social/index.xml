      <description>__  PSA - Today’s blog is about a space where my knowledge is fairly limited. Please feel free to point out any stupid ideas I have proposed.
I have had the fortune in some extremely rewarding discussion over the last few weeks. All of these discussion centre around some or the challenge that we are trying to approach in the development sector, civic engagement space. While having these discussions I always found myself landing on the same fundamental challenge, no matter what the sector or problem was being discussed.</description>

      <description>__  I have been thinking of quitting Twitter for a while, it’s one of the only remaining social media platforms I am still using. The other is Reddit, that shit is too sacred. But the thought of deleting my Twitter account has crossed my mind a few times, the negativity that platform radiates is at another level. But that is not what today’s post is about. It’s more about information and the role Twitter is playing in it.</description>

      <description>__  I have worked in the development sector for a few years now and will probably do so for the rest of my life. This is the only thing I find worth doing. I have worked with with non-profits, CSR teams, volunteer organisations and more. I am pretty thankful I got to do some of that work I did, along the way I got to learn a lot about how the system of working in the sector works.</description>

      <title>The Suite Life of Data Stories</title>

      <description>__  Landscape The extensive list of challenges the development sector faces are well documented and understood. One aspect that I beleive is still underserved is the data literacy and capacity of the organisation in the space. In today’s world where data has become such a key factor in of the impact conversation, for good or for bad, it requires more attention. Even when substantial data collection efforts are undertaken by any organisation, the data architecture is always an after thought.</description>
