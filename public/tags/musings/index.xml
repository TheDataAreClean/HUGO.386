      <description>__  I you have been reading this blog or know me personally you might know I give a shit (or two) about education, specially the state of education in India. There are a lot of reasons behind it, but it mainly boils down to two big arguments. First, I wholeheartedly believe that quality holistic education, education with the development of the individual at it’s core, is one of, if not the biggest factor to sustainable development in this world.</description>

      <description>__  I want to talk about a topic that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. I don’t remember how young was I when I first understood it’s meaning, but I remember thinking: “Sure, this makes sense.”. And something else that fascinated me was how much everyone hypes it up. I am talking about death. Yep, today I will be discussing the D word and related things.</description>

      <description>__  I moved to Bangalore a couple of years ago and I absolutely love it here. Sure, the traffic is annoying and the cost of living is a little higher than I would prefer, other than that I have very little to complain. One reason is that I moved here from Delhi where I lived for over two decades, and the Delhi I left was nothing like the the one I grew up in.</description>

      <description>__  PSA - I don’t remember if I have written on this topic before. But this is what is present for me right now and I am too lazy to check.
I am restless as fuck, like peak restless. I cannot sit still for one minute. I am either always doing something, on my way to do something or planning what to do next. Ask me at any moment during the entire day what I want to do, I have atleast 2-3 things always on my mind I want to get back to.</description>

      <description>__  Rant I have realised that I am getting old now. I am a very morning person who gets up at 6 and sleeps latest by 10 every night, haven’t stuck to it since the writing journey began, but I still make sure I don’t stretch it. Yesterday I worked late into the the night for the first time in years and didn’t get enough sleep. The entire day today I was exhausted out of my mind, to the point I had to take a nap in the middle of the day to feel better.</description>

      <description>__  Mistakes I have a big learning problem, learning from my experiences that is. I have to really go to the extreme and be completely smashed to bits before I understand, that maybe I have made a mistake going down this path. It’s still a maybe. And by the time I realise it, I have already invested so much energy and time into the task it sort of becomes a point of no return.</description>

      <description>__  Not a Ted Talk I am going to start today’s blog with a random question. What inspires someone? Don’t worry, this is not one of those self help blogs, I am just curious. Also I was struggling with topics to write about, happens when you are doing it for 18th day in a row
But getting back to the point, what keeps you ticking? Is it support of friends and family?</description>

      <description>__  I had a fairly fruitful weekend this time around. Went on a couple of great walks, got enough time to relax, wrote a series of blogs on a topic I deeply care about. And I am fairly proud of what I wrote. If you’d have asked me earlier will I ever write anything like this, specially during a pandemic, I would’ve laughed at you. And then I would’ve laughed at myself.</description>

      <description>__  Flashback ! In yesterday’s blog I tried to highlight the fact that the education system in India is a shit show. There is an immediate need for a larger understanding of the ecosystem to bring in any meaningful, sustainable change. With that in mind, today I am discussing one of the ideas currently in the research phase. The issue of child rights and it’s connection to education.</description>

      <description>__  Friday evening all of us at work were doing another video call, but this time it was not work. We were discussing how everything has changed since the pandemic and what do we miss about everyday life. Some background, we are a completely remote organisation without any physical office space, but people used to meet, work together, learn from each other and most importantly about each other.</description>

      <description>__  If you have come here for the first time, welcome! It’s mostly me talking about my feelings and other shit. And if you have been here before, you know the drill. Nothing beyond this statement is going to make any sense.
So if you have been here before you might also know that last week I made a commitment to write for 100 days straight to get over my fear of writing and improve my skills along the way.</description>

      <description>__  Yesterday, I took the “brave” step of publishing my first ever blog. It was mostly an announcement about of this journey I have embarked on. Somewhere in the mix was also this GRAND declaration of writing everyday for 100 days. 100 days of stuff which I feel is worth talking about. That’s a lot of stuff, especially when I live alone, talk to just 3 people and have no clue how popular culture works.</description>

      <description>__  Hello not-so-gentle people of the interwebs, welcome to my blog.
Who am I? I am cube, yes cube, I am a fairly private person and incredibly awkward at times so let’s just go with that. It’s not like you won’t find my name on the internet if you look around, but why offer it myself?
 What is this blog about? Who the fuck even knows? There are a lot of things that excite me; open education, data privacy, cycling, books !</description>
