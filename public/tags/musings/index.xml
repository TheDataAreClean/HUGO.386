      <description>__  I recently noticed a pattern in my daily blogs, specially the ones which are more personal. I start by telling something about myself, my habits, my way of being, or something else. I follow it up by contradicting myself literally in the next fucking statement. I am still not clear how I always end up doing that. Maybe it’s growth in certain aspects of life, maybe I a don’t know anything about myself at all.</description>

      <description>__  I had been sitting for over 30 minutes, pondering what do I write about today. I had a fairly exhausting day and am travelling this weekend, both keeping my mind fairly occupied. I am also sitting with this feeling of being annoyed and thinking, I still have to finish writing bedfore I end my day. Noticing my annoyance I wonder, was committing to 100 days of writing a good idea.</description>

      <description>__  Work I have only had a little over 4 years of professional work experience till now, but it has been a pretty fascinating journey. The amount I have personally evolved, from the people and places I have been involved with, to all the good and bad decisions I have made is really something. I get this sense of becoming a new person everytime I switch jobs, someone with a better understanding of the world around themselves.</description>

      <description>__  Note - I skipped writing at my regular time today, and am writing this at 0102 HRS on 2nd September. I was extremely tired today (yesterday) and had to take a nap to feel better. Technically I skipped a day even though this blog goes out before next morning. Does this still count? Let me know what you think!
Consistent Today (tonight) I want to talk about something that has been nagging me for a while.</description>

      <description>__  Milestone Today marks one month of me writing and publishing a new blog every day. It’s been an insane experience and something I would’ve never imagined myself doing. As I am almost a third of the way into my journey of writing for 100 days. I thought I will do one of those reflection blogs. Share my experience of setting up and writing this blog with everyone.</description>

      <description>__  I have been thinking of quitting Twitter for a while, it’s one of the only remaining social media platforms I am still using. The other is Reddit, that shit is too sacred. But the thought of deleting my Twitter account has crossed my mind a few times, the negativity that platform radiates is at another level. But that is not what today’s post is about. It’s more about information and the role Twitter is playing in it.</description>

      <description>__  I have a small confession to make. I absolutely didn’t feel like writing today. I have been working on a report and for the last couple of weeks and writing the first draft and it’s become a bit of an overload. I was struggling nailing down a topic for today and have started writing this at 22:31 HRS, by which time I am usually asleep, and I still don’t have a clear idea on today’s blog.</description>

      <description>__  PSA - I have had an extremely long week and am exhausted as fuck. Probably just going to steal some ideas from my research and spew some garbage. Let me know if it’s too bad. Or just skip it, I don’t want you to suffer through this.
As mentioned in one of my earlier blogs, I have been working on a report to better understand the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystem in India.</description>

      <description>__  Struggle As I mentioned few days ago, I am planning to go back to Delhi for a bit. Just see the family, hopefully relax a little and come back fresh. One thing I didn’t mention is how I am mostly doing this against my will. My family had been raising the point of me visiting for a while, and the pandemic was (still is) making it difficult to travel so I just kept pushing it.</description>

      <description>__  I you have been reading this blog or know me personally you might know I give a shit (or two) about education, specially the state of education in India. There are a lot of reasons behind it, but it mainly boils down to two big arguments. First, I wholeheartedly believe that quality holistic education, education with the development of the individual at it’s core, is one of, if not the biggest factor to sustainable development in this world.</description>

      <description>__  I want to talk about a topic that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. I don’t remember how young was I when I first understood it’s meaning, but I remember thinking: “Sure, this makes sense.”. And something else that fascinated me was how much everyone hypes it up. I am talking about death. Yep, today I will be discussing the D word and related things.</description>

      <description>__  I moved to Bangalore a couple of years ago and I absolutely love it here. Sure, the traffic is annoying and the cost of living is a little higher than I would prefer, other than that I have very little to complain. One reason is that I moved here from Delhi where I lived for over two decades, and the Delhi I left was nothing like the the one I grew up in.</description>

      <description>__  PSA - I don’t remember if I have written on this topic before. But this is what is present for me right now and I am too lazy to check.
I am restless as fuck, like peak restless. I cannot sit still for one minute. I am either always doing something, on my way to do something or planning what to do next. Ask me at any moment during the entire day what I want to do, I have atleast 2-3 things always on my mind I want to get back to.</description>

      <description>__  Rant I have realised that I am getting old now. I am a very morning person who gets up at 6 and sleeps latest by 10 every night, haven’t stuck to it since the writing journey began, but I still make sure I don’t stretch it. Yesterday I worked late into the the night for the first time in years and didn’t get enough sleep. The entire day today I was exhausted out of my mind, to the point I had to take a nap in the middle of the day to feel better.</description>

      <description>__  Mistakes I have a big learning problem, learning from my experiences that is. I have to really go to the extreme and be completely smashed to bits before I understand, that maybe I have made a mistake going down this path. It’s still a maybe. And by the time I realise it, I have already invested so much energy and time into the task it sort of becomes a point of no return.</description>

      <description>__  Not a Ted Talk I am going to start today’s blog with a random question. What inspires someone? Don’t worry, this is not one of those self help blogs, I am just curious. Also I was struggling with topics to write about, happens when you are doing it for 18th day in a row
But getting back to the point, what keeps you ticking? Is it support of friends and family?</description>

      <description>__  I had a fairly fruitful weekend this time around. Went on a couple of great walks, got enough time to relax, wrote a series of blogs on a topic I deeply care about. And I am fairly proud of what I wrote. If you’d have asked me earlier will I ever write anything like this, specially during a pandemic, I would’ve laughed at you. And then I would’ve laughed at myself.</description>

      <description>__  Flashback ! In yesterday’s blog I tried to highlight the fact that the education system in India is a shit show. There is an immediate need for a larger understanding of the ecosystem to bring in any meaningful, sustainable change. With that in mind, today I am discussing one of the ideas currently in the research phase. The issue of child rights and it’s connection to education.</description>

      <description>__  Friday evening all of us at work were doing another video call, but this time it was not work. We were discussing how everything has changed since the pandemic and what do we miss about everyday life. Some background, we are a completely remote organisation without any physical office space, but people used to meet, work together, learn from each other and most importantly about each other.</description>

      <description>__  If you have come here for the first time, welcome! It’s mostly me talking about my feelings and other shit. And if you have been here before, you know the drill. Nothing beyond this statement is going to make any sense.
So if you have been here before you might also know that last week I made a commitment to write for 100 days straight to get over my fear of writing and improve my skills along the way.</description>

      <description>__  Yesterday, I took the “brave” step of publishing my first ever blog. It was mostly an announcement about of this journey I have embarked on. Somewhere in the mix was also this GRAND declaration of writing everyday for 100 days. 100 days of stuff which I feel is worth talking about. That’s a lot of stuff, especially when I live alone, talk to just 3 people and have no clue how popular culture works.</description>

      <description>__  Hello not-so-gentle people of the interwebs, welcome to my blog.
Who am I? I am cube, yes cube, I am a fairly private person and incredibly awkward at times so let’s just go with that. It’s not like you won’t find my name on the internet if you look around, but why offer it myself?
 What is this blog about? Who the fuck even knows? There are a lot of things that excite me; open education, data privacy, cycling, books !</description>
