      <description>__  A few months ago, I started this personal research project better understand the challenges of education sector in India from two lenses of Child Rights and FOSS. I was extremely excited about the idea, and wanted to try a bunch of things.
Once I started researching I realised that how a small idea in my head just turned into this vast universe. Now matter how I tried to address it, I was getting lost in more and more questions.</description>
