      <description>__  Incoming I am travelling to Delhi this weekend, and plan to stay there with my family for a bit. And I have a lot of feelings about it. Feelings range on everything from excited to seeing Delhi again since January, to relaxing a little bit at home, to meeting my sister and so much more.
 Sadness But the feeling that is stronger than all the others is probably sadness.</description>

      <description>__  Struggle As I mentioned few days ago, I am planning to go back to Delhi for a bit. Just see the family, hopefully relax a little and come back fresh. One thing I didnâ€™t mention is how I am mostly doing this against my will. My family had been raising the point of me visiting for a while, and the pandemic was (still is) making it difficult to travel so I just kept pushing it.</description>

      <description>__  I moved to Bangalore a couple of years ago and I absolutely love it here. Sure, the traffic is annoying and the cost of living is a little higher than I would prefer, other than that I have very little to complain. One reason is that I moved here from Delhi where I lived for over two decades, and the Delhi I left was nothing like the the one I grew up in.</description>
