      <description>__  PSA - Todayâ€™s blog is about a space where my knowledge is fairly limited. Please feel free to point out any stupid ideas I have proposed.

All of these discussion centre around some or the challenge that we are trying to approach in the development sector, civic engagement space. While having these discussions I always found myself landing on the same fundamental challenge, no matter what the sector or problem was being discussed.</description>
