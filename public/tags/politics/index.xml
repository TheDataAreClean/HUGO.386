      <description>__  One of the biggest grinds I have with living at home is my parents watch a lot of television. Nothing wrong with that, please go ahead watch as much as you like, enjoy the fuck out of it. But at our home, family time is television time. That means you have to sit with them while they also simultaneously entertain themselves with objectionable garbage.
I on the other hand absolutely despise television, specially the ones that are turned on.</description>
