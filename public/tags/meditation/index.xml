      <description>__  Note - I skipped writing at my regular time today, and am writing this at 0102 HRS on 2nd September. I was extremely tired today (yesterday) and had to take a nap to feel better. Technically I skipped a day even though this blog goes out before next morning. Does this still count? Let me know what you think!
Consistent Today (tonight) I want to talk about something that has been nagging me for a while.</description>
