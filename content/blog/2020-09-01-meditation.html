<p><strong>Note</strong> - I skipped writing at my regular time today, and am writing this at 0102 HRS on 2nd September. I was extremely tired today (yesterday) and had to take a nap to feel better. Technically I skipped a day even though this blog goes out before next morning. Does this still count? Let me know what you think!</p>
<div id="consistent" class="section level1">
<h1>Consistent</h1>
<p>Today (tonight) I want to talk about something that has been nagging me for a while. I have not be able to consistently meditate for a while now. It’s a habit that I have not been able to hold on to as much as I would like to. And as I result I feel like I am becoming more jittery and annoyed with every passing day.</p>
</div>
<div id="focus" class="section level1">
<h1>Focus</h1>
<p>I have been a pretty hyperactive kid my entire life, I easily get distracted, find difficult to think about just one thing during a conversation and always wanted to move onto the next thing as quickly as possible. I find it really difficult to take breaks, to the point I have to add them to my schedule so I can remind myself to relax. Frankly, it’s a little exhausting.</p>
<p>Meditation used to help. Even though I used to suck at the whole thing, it gave me a benchmark on how I want to go about my life everyday. Where do I want to be more patient, where do I want to be aware.</p>

<div id="jittery" class="section level1">
<h1>Jittery</h1>
<p>Ever since I have dropped the ball on doing this consistently, I feel like my quality of engagements has gone down way below than what it was earlier. I always feel jumpy and impatient with stuff, which I had stopped experiencing for a while. My attention span has drastically decreased, even with my morning routine of wanting to start my day slowly, I am constantly thinking about everything that I will do when the day starts. Not giving myself any break.</p>
</div>
<div id="formula" class="section level1">
<h1>Formula</h1>
<p>Meditating is tough, you have to try intentionally every day and take small steps before you make a habit out of it. I have been struggling with continuously practicing meditation ever since the pandemic has dawned upon us. Cycling used to be an extremely meditative process and used to bring help me sort my day. But since even that has become irregular, I have found it difficult to pin down something that works for me now.</p>
</div>
<div id="starts" class="section level1">
<h1>Starts</h1>
<p>First day of the month has always been great motivators for me to start something new. The idea of newness motivates me to try to make a change. That’s how I started this blog, and that’s how I plan to start meditating again. Hopefully I will get back to it.</p>
