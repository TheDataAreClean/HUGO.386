<p>Today, I officially complete the one week state mandated quarantine after traveling back to Delhi. Tomorrow, I will be a free bird! But before I get too excited about it, I thought it might be useful to look back and see how I feel about the whole thing. Also, feeling lazy and today’s topic just writes itself.</p>
<p>The tricky bit during the entire quarantine from the get go was convincing my parents, especially my mom, that the quarantine is important. We live in a small house with four people, there are not a lot of places you can go to away from each other. The personal space is fairly limited. The entire quarantine week was a bargain exercise with my mum, who started with 1 day and slowly agreed to 4 before accepting defeat to the full week.</p>
<p>My entire footprint in the house was mostly contained in 10 steps from the bedroom to bathroom, sometime during evenings U used to open the balcony gate and get some fresh air. The whole thing was even trickier because I essentially had to throw my sister out of our (her) room to begin with. Starting tomorrow we will be sharing the room again after 2 years for an elongated period. Nothing can save us from the hell we will witness.</p>
<p>In some ways, the quarantine also helped me and my family to get used to each other’s ways. We live very different lives, I have made a way for myself since I have started living alone. The quarantine just gave us the distant view of what we are getting into while also maintaining a safe distance. The real thing will be insane, but we shall survive.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am just looking forward to Delhi again. Sure I will not be able to go everywhere, sure I will have to be super careful with the number off cases just climbing again, I still want to experience the city again. I have changed so much since I last visited, I wonder how the city feels now.</p>
