<ul>

<p>What to do if you are an emotional person?</p>
<p>Do you accept your feelings?<br />
Or do you fight them?<br />
Do you get lost in the mess?<br />
Or do you ride them?</p>
<p>Should I wear them on my wrist?<br />
Or should I hide them?<br />
Should I share them with everyone?<br />
Or should I put aside them? - <em>Just for the rhymezzz !</em></p>
<p>Will the world accept it?
Or will it vilify them?
If all it will be is regret,
Should I even try then?</p>
<p>What to do, if you are emotional person..</p>
<p><strong><em>TATA!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>cube</em></strong></p>
