What to do if you are an emotional person? 

Do you accept your feelings?   
Or do you fight them?  
Do you get lost in the mess?  
Or do you ride them?  

Should I wear them on my wrist?  
Or should I hide them?  
Should I share them with everyone?  
Or should I put aside them? - _Just for the rhymezzz !_

Will the world accept it?  
Or will it vilify them?  
If all it will be is regret,  
Should I even try then?  

What to do, if you are an emotional person..
