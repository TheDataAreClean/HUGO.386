* __

It was one of those days today. I woke up late in the morning, didn't have my coffee, didn't read my newsletters, just sat down to work as my first piece of action. I love absolutely love my work, but I never want to start my day there. I want to come to it all fresh and breezy, bringing every bit of excitement to start doing my thing. And all the things I mentioned before help me do just that, exactly those things. Never more, never less.

As a result I was uneasy the entire day, moving from one thing to another never feeling satisfied. Even when the work was good, the day felt incomplete. I kept opening my newsletters in new tabs of my browser, staring at them, unsuccessfully trying to find time to read. In the evening when I finally did get some time, I was exhausted and annoyed and couldn't bring myself to read a single word.

I am a creature of habit. I love doing my daily list of small things. My days are planned in advance and I know exactly what I want to do. The routine brings a kind of stability which just supports everything. I highly  [recommend](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/magazine/my-father-leaned-on-routine-to-create-stability-now-i-do-too.html){target="_blank"} this to everyone. It's this unparalleled peace of mind that no matter what comes your way, some things will always be there.

But there are also days like today, when things don't go exactly the way you planned and you get thrown off the path a little bit. And when you rely on these micro habits, any resistance feels like being hit by a truck. How do you do everything else when you can't do your regular shit.

I believe that's also the great thing about routine, you can just go back to it tomorrow. I know exactly what I will be doing when I wake up tomorrow morning, and I already love it. 

That's all for today I guess, some half baked thoughts. I am too tired and annoyed for anything more that that. Maybe I will give the newsletters another shot before I got to sleep.
