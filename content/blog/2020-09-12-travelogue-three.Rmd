description: 'The week that was..'

* __

Today, I officially complete the one week state mandated quarantine after traveling back to Delhi. Tomorrow, I will be a free bird! But before I get too excited about it, I thought it might be useful to look back and see how I feel about the whole thing. Also, feeling lazy and today's topic just writes itself.

The tricky bit during the entire quarantine from the get go was convincing my parents, especially my mom, that the quarantine is important. We live in a small house with four people, there are not a lot of places you can go to away from each other. The personal space is fairly limited. The entire quarantine week was a bargain exercise with my mum, who started with 1 day and slowly agreed to 4 before accepting defeat to the full week. 

My entire footprint in the house was mostly contained in 10 steps from the bedroom to bathroom, sometime during evenings U used to open the balcony gate and get some fresh air. The whole thing was even trickier because I essentially had to throw my sister out of our (her) room to begin with. Starting tomorrow we will be sharing the room again after 2 years for an elongated period. Nothing can save us from the hell we will witness.

In some ways, the quarantine also helped me and my family to get used to each other's ways. We live very different lives, I have made a way for myself since I have started living alone. The quarantine just gave us the distant view of what we are getting into while also maintaining a safe distance. The real thing will be insane, but we shall survive. 

Lastly, I am just looking forward to Delhi again. Sure I will not be able to go everywhere, sure I will have to be super careful with the number off cases just climbing again, I still want to experience the city again. I have changed so much since I last visited, I wonder how the city feels now.
