<div id="rant" class="section level1">
<h1>Rant</h1>
<p>I have realised that I am getting old now. I am a very morning person who gets up at 6 and sleeps latest by 10 every night, haven’t stuck to it since the writing journey began, but I still make sure I don’t stretch it. Yesterday I worked late into the the night for the first time in years and didn’t get enough sleep. The entire day today I was exhausted out of my mind, to the point I had to take a nap in the middle of the day to feel better. Also there is my declining fitness and weak knees all acting up due to reduced exercising through the pandemic. Wow, look at me rant like an old man. It’s finally come to that, next I will be complaining about kids playing cricket too loudly.</p>

<div id="blog" class="section level1">
<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>But I digress. Today I wanted extend my conversation around learning from <a href="https://thedataareclean.com/blog/2020-08-18-inspiracion/" target="_blank">yesterday</a> to the other part, which I believe is even more difficult to grasp. Unlearning. Discarding the outdated information in your head that drives the entire narrative of your life. You know, the easy stuff.</p>
</div>
<div id="new-day-new-analogy" class="section level1">
<h1>New day, new analogy</h1>
<p>Think about anything that we do as a normal in everyday life, for example wearing clothes. Why do wear clothes? If you look back into the human history, the need for clothing came out of the necessity when we as a species started to migrate to colder climates to which our bodies weren’t naturally acclamatised. Between then and now a lot things have happened including colonisation and capitalism becoming the dominant narratives of our world. And clothing went from a thing of need to default. And here we are sitting alone in our homes, you reading this and me writing fully clothed for no apparent reason.</p>
</div>
<div id="eveything-else" class="section level1">
<h1>Eveything else</h1>
<p>It may sound pretty far fetched, but bear with me for a second here. That’s what I believe needs to happen. We need to question the defaults of the world and think do we do something because it’s a default or because we really need it? Figuring out the systemic bullshit that has been fed to us through the prevalent toxic ideologies and unlearn. To learn some real shit.</p>
<p>I would go as far as saying we don’t need clothes all the time and I wish there was a world where that was possible. I understand there our other implications of this thought, which BTW I am happy to argue another day or over a chat. Feel free to disagree!</p>
</div>
<div id="ch-ch-ch-ch-changes" class="section level1">
<h1>Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes</h1>
<p>Why I am arguing this today is two fold, something personal and something I wish for the world. Like I mentioned yesterday it sometime takes longer than usual for me to learn. That happens because we live in a society where a lot of harmful narratives are supported and promoted creating implicit systems of hierarchy that no ones thinks to challenge. Then there is also this larger wish I have for the world to break from all this institutionalised oppression and make a better world, which does not go about creating stupid hierarchies in every fucking system.</p>
</div>
<div id="viva-la-revolución" class="section level1">
<h1>Viva la Revolución</h1>
<p>I understand that my big words don’t mean anything and most real change happens on the ground slowly but steadily. But I still feel it’s important to drop these ideas into the world now and again so that folks who are thinking along the same lines know they are not alone and there are others who are willing to come along. Both you and I gotta grow bud! Pun intended.</p>
<p><strong>PS.</strong> Today is <strong>Day 20</strong> of my writing journey. I will be celebrating these small milestones I achieve till Day 100, keeps me pumped!</p>
