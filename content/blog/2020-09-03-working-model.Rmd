# Work
I have only had a little over 4 years of professional work experience till now, but it has been a pretty fascinating journey. The amount I have personally evolved, from the people and places I have been involved with, to all the good and bad decisions I have made is really something. I get this sense of becoming a new person everytime I switch jobs, someone with a better understanding of the world around themselves. Of their world atleast. 

# Not Work
I really love my work, like a lot. If I want to spend atleast 8 hours everyday doing something, in most cases my work would be the answer. But none of that "If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life" crap. You will work and you will get tired, everyone needs a break and a change. It's just more difficult to realise in the space you love working, because you care about everything so much.

# Balance
The key is finding the right balance, how you what to work, what you want to work on and what do you want to get out of it. And the answer is ofcourse different for everyone. People have different working style, different schedules and different lives. It just becomes trickier to find the balance when all you care about is closely related to work.

# Bucket
I was talking to my friends on the same topic today and about finding the right balance. How do some people manage to stretch themselves and get more done in the same amount of time as the rest of us. Not when other people are lazy, but when some of the folks are just more efficient and productive. I believe they are just wizards who can compartmentalise and prioritise better than the rest of us. They are just able to focus on that one thing and achieve it, rather than obsessing over one small inconsequential detail to the point when work is waiting for you and you are just too tired to attempt it anymore.

# Manage
After a long (relatively) journey I have reached this point where I know exactly the kind of work I want to do and the goals I want to work towards. It's an extremely privileged place to be in. The most important thing would be finding that balance between work and non-work stuff and being able to set that boundary on what work means for me and everyone involved. All while just focusing on the thing at hand.

**PS.** I am realising a lot of my blogs are just my extended thoughts on conversations I have had with my friends. I am eternally grateful to them for equipping me with this free content.
