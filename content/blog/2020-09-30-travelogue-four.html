<p>Have you ever been so blank that you thought of writing about an interesting conversation your parents but can’t think of anything to share?</p>
<p>Have you ever been so blank that you that you are exhausted out of you mind but can’t even think about sleeping?</p>
<p>Have you ever been so blank that you are hurt but don’t know how to fix it or if you even want to fix it?</p>
<p>Have you ever been so blank that you watch Naruto for two hours just to get over the exhaustion and sit down writing?</p>
<p>Have you ever been so blank that you can’t write even after the break and put together a random blog just to get done with day?</p>
<p>Have you ever been so blank that you can’t even be annoyed at the fact that you decided to write for 100 days straight?</p>
<p>Have you ever been so blank that you can’t seem to care about the world and are just tired of seeing everything crash at once?</p>
<p>Today is one of those days. Good night.</p>
