# HUGO.386

A blog built using a [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package in `R`.

## Theme

HUGO.386 is a port of the [BOOTSTRA.386](//github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386) theme. It has a cool MS-DOS feeling and is ready to be used for blogs. Despite its antique look, the theme is responsive and can be viewed on mobile devices.

Developed by [Max le Fou](https://gitlab.com/maxlefou), you can find more about the theme [here](https://gitlab.com/maxlefou/hugo.386).

## Contents

I was inspired by the [100 Day Writing Challenge](https://listed.to/@Listed/5202/100-day-writing-challenge) on [Listed](https://listed.to/) to improve my writing skills. Though the journey only lasted for 61 days, you can find all the posts [here](https://github.com/TheDataAreClean/HUGO.386/tree/master/content/blog) or in a seperate repository [here](https://github.com/TheDataAreClean/100-days).
